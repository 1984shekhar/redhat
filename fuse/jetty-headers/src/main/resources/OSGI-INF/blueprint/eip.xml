   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the Camel context and routes.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the artifact is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the Camel namespaces.

      The namespace for the camelContext element in Blueprint is 'http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint'. We can also define 
      namespace prefixes we want to use in the XPath expressions in our CBR here.
      
      We defined the namespace prefix order so that we use the namespace from the order messages in the XPath expressions.

      While it is not required to assign id's to the <camelContext/> and <route/> elements, it is a good idea
      to set them for runtime management purposes (logging, JMX MBeans, ...)
